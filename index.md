### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2, was great for me. I learned how to use if and else statements which is used quite frequently in the later labs. I think that this is where the labs starting getting a little more technical. I enjoyed it because the game itself is pretty cool as well.

* Lab 2

    Although Lab 2, part 1, was very simple for the most part, this lab was the first time I ever got so frustrated at something. Formatting was still quite new since this was one of the first ever labs we were to complete so my partner and I had such a hard time figuring it out. We had no idea what was wrong and discovered that we just misspelled something.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1, was great for my partner and I because we had good chemistry. I really had a fun time working with him. We revisited an old game called secret word within this lab and it was quite interesting to see how we can use different functions to add more complexity to the game.
